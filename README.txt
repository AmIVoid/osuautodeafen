THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING OSU AUTO DEAFEN!


To use osu! auto deafen effectively, make sure the following programs are downloaded and are running in the background of 
osu! 
(KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE DOWNLOADED AND LAUNCHED AUTOMATICALLY UNLESS 
EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN SETTINGS)

========================
- https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory
========================

When GosuMemory! launches, launch osu! Auto Deafen right after. Be sure to configure your username in config.ini CORRECTLY before
running the program.

- Syntax rules for config.ini:
-- Make sure that usernames, words, etc. are within the quotation marks. ("") 
-- To turn a setting off/on, use true (on) and false (off). Keep in mind that these are case sensitive, and should ALWAYS be lowercase.

If everything goes right, in the console, you should see "Connected to GosuMemory. Make sure that it stays on when playing osu!"
Once you see this message, you are connected to osu! and are free to play any beatmap with autodeafen enabled!

Remember to set your deafen keybind on Discord to ALT+D, as this is the key combination that will be pressed when osu! Auto Deafen
is ready to deafen.
